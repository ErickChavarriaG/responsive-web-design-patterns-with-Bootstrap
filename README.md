# responsive-web-design-patterns-with-Bootstrap

I will demonstrate 4 web design patterns using Bootstrap 3:

1. The Mostly Fluid Pattern
2. The Column Drop Pattern
3. The Layout Shifter Pattern
4. Same Sized Columns
 

The Mostly Fluid Pattern - http://aurimas.darguzis.com/projects/Mostly-Fluid-Pattern/ 

  One of the problems we have when we are working with web design and we are going from a multi-column layout down to a single-column layout, is how exactly do we want to stack the columns. There is no hard and fast rule, and it is totally up to the web designer, but in a lot of cases you might want your major content to come first. So instead of showing the left aside column, we would want to list out the articles from middle section. I have setted up three column layout to start with - left-side aside column, middle section for articles and right-side aside column. Now Bootstrap is a Mobile first technology. Things work out better if we arrange things for mobile, and on mobile we are gong to want the middle section to be first. I am going to use col-xx-push and col-xx-pull classes to achieve desired result.
